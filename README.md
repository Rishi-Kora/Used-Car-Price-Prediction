Project Name - Used Car Price Prediction<br>

To develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the price of used cars based on their features. The model aims to assist buyers and sellers in making informed decisions about car pricing.<br>

Project Methodology:<br>

1. Data Collection and Preparation: The project uses a dataset of used cars from various brands. This data is cleaned and transformed, including handling missing values, removing outliers, and creating new features.<br>

2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis is performed on the data to understand the distributions of features and their relationships. This analysis provides insights for model selection.<br>

3. Feature Engineering: Relevant features are extracted and transformed to improve the performance of the model. This includes creating new variables (e.g., car age) and encoding categorical variables.<br>

4. Model Selection and Training: Several machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Network, are trained and evaluated. The best-performing model is chosen based on metrics like R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).<br>

5. Model Evaluation and Interpretation: The final model is rigorously tested on a holdout dataset. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values are used to interpret the model's predictions and understand the impact of each feature on price.<br>
