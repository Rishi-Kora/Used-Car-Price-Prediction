## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the fair market value of used cars using machine learning techniques. The dataset is analyzed, cleaned, and modeled using a variety of regression algorithms to find the best fit.

---

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following features:

- Manufacturer  
- Model  
- Year of Manufacture  
- Mileage  
- Fuel Type  
- Transmission Type  
- Engine Size  
- Number of Owners  
- Location  
- Price (target variable)

Data preprocessing includes:

- Handling missing values  
- Encoding categorical variables  
- Removing outliers  
- Feature scaling

## Methodology

### 1. Data Collection & Preparation

- Data collected from public car listings.
- Cleaning, type conversion, and formatting for consistency.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Univariate and bivariate visualizations  
- Outlier detection  
- Correlation analysis

### 3. Feature Engineering

- Encoding of categorical variables  
- Extraction of new features from existing ones

### 4. Model Training

Models tested:

- Linear Regression  
- Decision Tree Regressor  
- Random Forest Regressor  
- Gradient Boosting Regressor  

### 5. Model Evaluation

Metrics used:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
- RÂ² Score  

### 6. Deployment (Optional)

This notebook can be extended into a web app using frameworks like Flask or Streamlit.

## Results and Findings

- Engine size and car age are strong predictors of price.  
- Cars with automatic transmission and diesel engines generally hold higher value.  
- The Random Forest Regressor achieved the best performance on test data.  
- Feature importance analysis revealed useful pricing insights.
